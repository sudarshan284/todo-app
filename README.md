Hi all, this project is part of my backend learning journey using Node.js.
Technologies used in this project are Express JS, Node.js, and Typescript.
For checking the error, we have inbuilt Express libraries.
To run this project, just Clone the repo and run the command NPM install to get all the necessary packages for this project.
After that, just run NPM start, and the server will start running on the specified port.
